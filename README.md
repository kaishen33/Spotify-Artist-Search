### Overview

It is an open website to find song, artist, or album and bring out everything associated with the search. Anything typed into the searchbar will bring out artist definition, famous albums, and songs

The application is made up the home page only.

##### Accesssing Home page

The home page only has the searchbar for the user to type. Once the user clicks the search button, the page will load lyrics, album name, and artist name.

##### Technology

* VS Code v1.47.1
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Ajax
* Rapidapi

##### Front-End

Traditional html and css handles the design of the front page.

jQuery was used for all the functionality of the application. Ajax calls were used to talk to the database to pull data from the rapid api url key.

##### Back-End

Database of the website is all in rapid api. Although the script is technically front-end, its function is to communicate withe the pre-made backend data.
